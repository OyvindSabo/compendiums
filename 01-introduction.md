# Introduction

## Why Parallel Computing?

### Why we need to write parallel programs

*"An efficient parallel implementation of a serial program may not be obtained by
finding efficient parallelizations of each of its steps. Rather, the best parallelization may be obtained by stepping back and devising an entirely new algorithm."* - Peter Pacheco

## Parallel Hardware and Parallel Software

### The von Neumann architecture
*"The separation of memory and CPU is often called the **von Neumann bottleneck**, since the interconnect determines the rate at which instructions and data can be accessed."* - Peter Pacheco
