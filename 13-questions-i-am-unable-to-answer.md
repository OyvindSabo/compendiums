**True/False**
Some recent CUDA devices give you the option to trade-off amount of shared memory with caching.

**Multiple choice**\
Whick trick did Elster use to get the algorithm for generation a bit-reversed index from O(Nlog N) to O(N)?
- reuse old values and bit-shifts
- divide and conquer
- all of the above
- increase cache utilization

What method of optimization is used by the Atlas and FFTW libraries that make them so
hard to beat on systems with multiple levels of memory? hierarchies?
