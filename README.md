# TDT4200 Parallel Computing

I made this compendium as practice for my exam in parallel computing.\
I'm not sure if it helped a lot:(

The compendium is not finished and will probably never be. Feel free to contribute.

It is largely based on *Introduction to Parallel Programming* by Peter Pacheco, whose PDF version can be found here: http://bank.engzenon.com/download/5086c777-25f0-49f1-9819-3a0c4ad0ed3b/Introduction_to_Parallel_Programming.pdf

The compendium also consists of a mix of Stack Overflow answers, MPI documentation, and articles. Sadly, I have not linked any of my sources, as that was the least of my priorities while I was practicing.
