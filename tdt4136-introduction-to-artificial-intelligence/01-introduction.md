### Thinking humanly: The cognitive modelling approach
Newell and Simon, who developed GPS, the "General Problem Solver" (Newell and Simon, 1961), were not content to have their program correctly solve problems. They were more concerned with comparing the trace of its reasoning steps to traces of human subjects solving the same problems. This is in contrast to other researchers of the same time (such as Wang (I960)), who were concerned with getting the right answers regardless of how humans might do it.

Alan Newel and Herbert Simon suggested that any **physical symbol system** has necessary and sufficient means for general intelligent action

Although many, including Jefferson, have claimed that thinking necessarily involves consciousness, the issue is most commonly associated with the work of the philosopher John Searle.
