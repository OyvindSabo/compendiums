## 1.1 What is AI?

### Thinking humanly: The cognitive modelling approach
Newell and Simon, who developed GPS, the "General Problem Solver" (Newell and Simon, 1961), were not content to have their program correctly solve problems. They were more concerned with comparing the trace of its reasoning steps to traces of human subjects solving the same problems. This is in contrast to other researchers of the same time (such as Wang (I960)), who were concerned with getting the right answers regardless of how humans might do it.

Alan Newel and Herbert Simon suggested that any **physical symbol system** has necessary and sufficient means for general intelligent action

Although many, including Jefferson, have claimed that thinking necessarily involves consciousness, the issue is most commonly associated with the work of the philosopher John Searle.

## 1.2 The FOundation of Artificial Intelligence

### Decidability
In logic, a true/false decision problem is decidable if there exists an effective method for deriving the correct answer (instead of looping indefinitely, crashing, returning "don't know", or returning a wrong answer).

Kurt Godel's **incompleteness theorem** showed that in any language expressive enough to describe the properties of the natural numbers, there are true statements that are **undecidable**: their truth cannot be established by any algorithm.

Alan Turing showed that there were some functions that no Turing machine can compute. These classes of problems are said to be **undecidable**. For example, no machine can tell in general whether a given program will return an answer on a given input, or run forever.
