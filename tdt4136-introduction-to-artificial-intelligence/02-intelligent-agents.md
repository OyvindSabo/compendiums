# Intelligent Agents

## 2.2 How Agents Should Act

**Ideal rational agent**\
For each possible percept sequence, an ideal rational agent should do whatever action is expected to maximize its performance measure, on the basis of the evidence provided by the percept sequence and whatever built-in knowledge the agent has.

## 2.3 Structure of intelligent agents

### Simple reflect agents
**Simple reflex agents** are purely reactive agents. They act only on the basis of the current percept, ignoring the rest of the percept history. The agent function is based on the condition-action rule: if condition then action. **Simple reflex agents** only succeeds when the environment is **fully observable**. Infinite loops are often unavoidable for **simple reflex agents** operating in **partially observable environments**. The aent might be able to break out of the loop if it randomizes its actions.

## 2.4 Environments

in some competitive environments, randomized behavior is rational because
it avoids the pitfalls of predictability.
