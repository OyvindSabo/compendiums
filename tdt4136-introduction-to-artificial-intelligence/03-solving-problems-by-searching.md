**Arc-consistency**\
A state is arc-consistent
if every variable has a value in its domain that is consistent with each of the constraints on that variable. Arc consistency can be achieved by successive deletion of values that are inconsistent with some constraint. As values are deleted, other values may become inconsistent because they relied on the deleted values.
