Perform mini-max search and label each branch node with its value.

The Max player will always try to maximize the score, and the Min player will always try to minimize the score. Note that the score is the utility evaluation of the maximizing player's state, even when it's the minimizing player's turn.

This is the mini-max search tree with the branch nodes labeled with their values. We see that Max's best move is B, which will give a utility of 5.
