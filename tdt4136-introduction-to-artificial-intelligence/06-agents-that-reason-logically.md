# Agents that Reason Logically

### Inference
The terms **"reasoning"** and **"inference"** are generally used to cover any process by which conclusions are reached.

### Validity
A sentence is **valid** or **necessarily true** if and only if it is true under all possible interpretations in all possible worlds, that is, regardless of what it is supposed to mean and regardless of the state
of affairs in the universe being described.

### Satisfiability
A sentence is satisfiable if and only if there is some interpretation in some world for
which it is true.
