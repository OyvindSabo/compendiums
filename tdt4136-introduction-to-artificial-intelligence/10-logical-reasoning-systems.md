# Logical Reasoning Systems

## 10.1 Introduction

### Frame systems
**Frame systems** use the metaphor that objects are nodes in a graph, that these nodes are organized in a taxonomic structure, and that links between nodes represent binary relations. In frame systems the binary relations are thought of as slots in one frame that are filled by another. 

### Semantic networks
Just like **frame systems**, **semantic networks** use the metaphor that objects are nodes in a graph, that these nodes are organized in a taxonomic structure, and that links between nodes represent binary relations. In semantic networks, however, the binary relations are thought of as arrows between nodes. In general, though, the term **semantics network** is used to describe both **semantic networks** and **frame systems**.
