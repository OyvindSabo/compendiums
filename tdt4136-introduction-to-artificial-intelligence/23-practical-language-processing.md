# Practical Language Processing

### Information retrieval
**Information retrieval** is the activity of obtaining information resources relevant to an information need from a collection of information resources. Searches can be based on metadata or on full-text indexing.

### information extraction
**Information extraction** is the task of automatically extracting structured information from unstructured and/or semi-structured machine-readable documents. In most of the cases this activity concerns processing human language texts by means of natural language processing (NLP). Recent activities in multimedia document processing like automatic annotation and content extraction out of images/audio/video could be seen as information extraction.

### When designing a language...
When designing a language it is important to try to restrict the **grammar**, as well as **ambiguity**.

### Distributional hypothesis
The **distributional hypothesis assumes that words that are used and occur in the same contexts tend to purport similar meanings.

### Bag-of-words model
In the **bag-of-words-model**, a text is represented as an unordered collection of words, disregarding grammar and even word order. Each unique word is stored once, along with the number of times that word appears. This aproach is generally used for document classification.

### N-gram
an **n-gram** is a contiguous sequence of n items from a given sample of text or speech. The items can be phonemes, syllables, letters, words or base pairs according to the application. The n-grams typically are collected from a text or speech corpus. An n-gram model is a type of probabilistic language model for predicting the next item in such a sequence in the form of a (n − 1)–order Markov model.
