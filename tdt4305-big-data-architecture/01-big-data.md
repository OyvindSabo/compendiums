# Big Data

## The three Vs
The three (or more) V's refer to the criteria for data to be considered Big Data.

**Volume:**\
Volume refers to the amount of data. In the field of Big Data, there can be enormous amounts of continuously generated data, by users, machines and sensors. Data volume can be categorized into the following categories (low to high volume):
- MB
- GB
- TB
- PB

**Variety:**\
Variety refers to the number of types of data. In Big Data deals with data which is not necessarily structured. Data variety can be categorized into the following categories (low to high variety):
- Table
- Data base
- Photo, web, audio
- Social, video, unstructured, mobile

**Velocity:**\
Velocity refers to the speed of data processing. In Big Data, the velocity in which data is generated can be very high, and as such, the processing velocity has to be high as well. Big Data often involves problems where data has to be processed in realtime. High velocity data often come in the form of streams. Data velocity can be categorized into the folowing categories (low to high velocity):
- Batch
- Periodic
- Near real time
- Real time

| Magnitude | Volume | Variety                             | Velocity       |
|-----------|--------|-------------------------------------|----------------|
| Low       | MB     | Table                               | Batch          |
| Medium    | GB     | Data base                           | Periodic       |
| High      | TB     | Photo, web, audio                   | Near real time |
| Very high | PB     | Social, video, unstructured, mobile | Real time      |

## Some other Vs

**Veracity**\
Veracity refers to how accurate and applicable the data is.

**Value**\
Value refers to the worth of the data being extracted. Having endless amounts of data is useless unless it can be turned into value.
