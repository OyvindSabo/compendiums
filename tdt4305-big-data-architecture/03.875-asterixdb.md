# AsterixDB

## Data feeds
- Built-in mechanism for new data to continuously be ingeste from external sources.
- Need to index "fast flowing" data.
- User queries work agains stored data, not the incoming stream.

While other analytics platforms query, but don't store data, both queries and stores data. Entries are initially stored in Memory, but are flushed to disk when exceeding a specific threshold.

## AsterixDB vs Spark
Spark is more of an analytics tool, and does not have its own file system. AsterixDB both queries and stores data.

## AsterixDB vs Storm & Spark
As opposed to Spark and Storm which work within the MapReduce paradigm where the user manually have to know the data structure and write own mappers and reducers, AsterixDB comes with its own AsterixDB Query Language (AQL) which can better utilize key mappings, thanks to its semi-structured file system, as opposed to reading unstructured text-files in Spark.
