## 3.3 The Capital Asset Pricing Model
The **Capital Asset Pricing Model** (**CAPM**) is a pricing relation for all risky assets, including inefficient portfolios and individual assets. The expected return **E(r<sub>i</sub>)** is given by the sum of the risk-free rate **r<sub>f</sub>** and the price of the risk (market risk premium) **E(r<sub>m</sub>) - r<sub>f</sub>** multiplied with the risk **β<sub>i</sub>**.

**E(r<sub>i</sub>) = r<sub>f</sub> + (E(r<sub>m</sub>) - r<sub>f</sub>)β<sub>i</sub>**

**Jensen's alpha**\
**Jensen's alpha** is a performance measure which is directly based on the **CAPM**. It measures the return of a portfolio in excess of what the **CAPM** specifies. Since Jensen's alpha uses **CAPM** as a benchmark, it is very easy to interpret. A major disadvavntage, though, is that alphas are different to compare between portfolios with different risk.

**α<sub>p</sub> = r̄<sub>p</sub> - (r̄<sub>f</sub> + B̂<sub>p</sub>(r̄<sub>m</sub> - r̄<sub>f</sub>))**
