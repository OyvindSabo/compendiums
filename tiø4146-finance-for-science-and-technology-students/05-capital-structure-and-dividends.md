## 5.3 Models of optimal capital structure

### 5.3.1 The trade-off theory
**The trade-off theory** models the cost of fnancial distress as a broad leverage-related cost category against which the tax advantage of debt is traded off.

**Cost of bankruptcy**\
The **cost of bankruptcy**, (also called **cost of financial distress**) is the costs that have to be incurred if debt is too high.
- Income can decrease or collabse as customers run away.
- Suppliers may stop delivering or require advance payment.
- Key prsonel may leave the company.
- Investors may require costly refinancing.
- Non-strategic assets may ahve to be sold at emergency prices.
- Risk-reducing financial instruments may no longer be available from banks.

A policy of renting offices or leasing equipment reduces the amount banks are willing to lend. This is because rented offices and leased equipment offer no security for loans. Owned buildings and equipment, however, can serve as collateral and can be taken and sold by the bank in case of an emergency. Owning assets, give lower **bankruptcy costs**, and therefore an optimal capital structure with more debt.
