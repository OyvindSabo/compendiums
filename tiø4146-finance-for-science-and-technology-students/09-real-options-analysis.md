**Making a replicating portfolio**\
To find out how many shares one has to buy or sell to replicate an option, simply use the formula:

**N(d<sub>1</sub>) - 1 = NormalDist(d<sub>1</sub>) - 1**

**Example**\
If an investor holds 100 stocks and wants to replicate an option portflio where N(d<sub>1</sub>) = 0.051...

0.051-1 = -0.48

This means that for each share the investor has, he needs to sell 0.48 shares. Since the investor has 100 shares, he needs to sell 48 shares to match the options portfolio.
